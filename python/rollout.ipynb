    "\n",
    "This notebook describes a utility included in the MuJoCo Python library that performs simulation \"rollouts\" with an underlying C++ function. The rollouts can be multithreaded. We provide examples of the speed of rollout compared to pure Python rollouts and MJX and give an application example that couples \"rollout\" with MuJoCo's \"minimze\" utility.\n",
